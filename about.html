            <h2 class="category-header text-[10px] font-bold uppercase tracking-[0.4em] mb-8">Background</h2>
            <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I am 55 years old and have been a consistent gym-goer for many years. Through regular resistance training and self-directed study of exercise physiology, I developed a strong interest in maintaining performance, strength, and metabolic health as we age. I am not a certified strength coach or medical professional—this site is not professional advice or a coaching service.
            </p>
            <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Like many in their 50s and beyond, I noticed that most available performance trackers, calculators, and diagnostic tools are designed with younger, competitive athletes in mind. Metrics, norms, and interpretations often fail to account for age-related changes in muscle maintenance, recovery, metabolic response, and functional capacity.
            </p>
            <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This led me to build the Academic Athlete Lab: a collection of straightforward, research-derived calculators and trackers optimized for the 50+ individual who wants to monitor and preserve strength, aerobic capacity, muscle mass, and overall metabolic health.

            <h2 class="category-header text-[10px] font-bold uppercase tracking-[0.4em] mb-8">Approach & Evidence Base</h2>
            <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Every lab on this site draws from established scientific literature on aging, exercise physiology, and longevity biomarkers. Examples include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-neutral-300 text-lg">
                <li>Resistance training as a primary countermeasure to sarcopenia and age-related muscle loss, with systematic reviews and meta-analyses showing positive effects on muscle strength, mass, gait speed, and functional performance in healthy older adults (e.g., European Review of Aging and Physical Activity, 2021; Scientific Reports, 2024).</li>
                <li>VO₂ max and grip strength as independent predictors of all-cause mortality and longevity in older populations, with higher levels associated with reduced mortality risk (e.g., meta-analyses linking cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength to lower all-cause and cardiovascular death rates).</li>
                <li>Age-related anabolic resistance, where older muscle shows a blunted response to protein intake, but resistance exercise can extend the window of elevated muscle protein synthesis (often up to 48 hours post-exercise), supporting the need for regular mechanical stimulus and adequate protein (e.g., reviews in Frontiers in Nutrition, 2024; Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews, 2013).</li>
                <li>Tracking of body composition indices (FFMI, SMI), metabolic markers (insulin sensitivity, hydration), and functional measures (mobility, recovery proxies) using validated formulas and age-adjusted references where available.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-neutral-400 text-base mt-8 italic font-mono">
                No claims are made beyond what the referenced science supports. These are self-tracking tools only—consult a physician or qualified professional before acting on any metrics.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-black uppercase italic mb-6 tracking-tighter text-purple-400">Purpose</h2>
            <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                To provide accessible, quantitative diagnostics that help the 50+ "academic athlete" make informed decisions about training, recovery, and lifestyle. The goal is preservation of function and independence through data, not competition or extreme performance.
