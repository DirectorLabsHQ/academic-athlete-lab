        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) represents the total amount of energy your body uses in a day — including resting metabolism, daily movement, training, and digestion. It’s the most practical snapshot of how much fuel your system actually requires to function and recover.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Metabolic drift</strong> describes the gradual decline in energy expenditure that often occurs with age. This drift is usually driven by loss of muscle mass, reduced daily movement, and inconsistent training — not by a single dramatic change.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The Metabolic Drift Lab estimates your TDEE using standard, research-backed formulas and helps you track whether your metabolic output is staying stable or slowly drifting downward over time.
        </p>

    <div class="bg-[#0e0e0e] border border-[#222] rounded-2xl p-8 mb-12">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            TDEE is not a daily number to chase. It’s a long-term trend. Meaningful changes usually appear over months, not weeks — which makes periodic tracking far more useful than constant recalculation.

        Why TDEE & Metabolic Drift Matter After 50
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        After 50, small declines in metabolic output can compound quickly. Slightly less muscle, slightly less movement, and slightly less recovery can lead to easier fat gain, lower energy availability, and slower progress — even when training effort feels high.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Maintaining TDEE is less about “burning more calories” and more about supporting the systems that help energy use remain efficient: muscle mass, movement capacity, and recovery quality.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-lg mb-6">
        <li>Supports stable body composition and energy levels</li>
        <li>Closely reflects muscle mass and daily movement</li>
        <li>Plays a role in recovery capacity and training consistency</li>
        <li>Highly responsive to resistance training and lifestyle habits</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-neutral-400 italic font-mono mb-8">
        Metabolism doesn’t slow because of age alone — it slows when it’s no longer challenged or supported.

        How to Estimate & Support TDEE (50+ Edition)
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The Metabolic Drift Lab uses standard metabolic equations adjusted for activity and training. While no estimate is perfect, consistency makes the trend meaningful.
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg mb-6">
        <li>Measure body weight under the same conditions each time (morning, fasted).</li>
        <li>Select an honest activity level that reflects daily movement and training.</li>
        <li>Enter values into the <a href="metabolic-lab.html" class="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300">Metabolic Drift Lab</a>.</li>
        <li>Recheck every 3–6 months, not weekly.</li>
        <li>Support TDEE with resistance training (2–3×/week), aerobic work, adequate protein (1.8–2.2 g/kg), sleep, and stress management.</li>

        Quick Next Step
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Establish your baseline TDEE in the <a href="metabolic-lab.html" class="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300">Metabolic Drift Lab</a>. Retest after your next training block. Over time, this number becomes a quiet indicator of whether your metabolism is holding steady — or slowly drifting.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Metabolism adapts to what you do consistently. Train, recover, and move accordingly.
