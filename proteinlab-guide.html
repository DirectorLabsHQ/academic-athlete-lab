            How to give your muscles a signal they still recognize — and respond to.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is the process through which your body repairs and builds muscle tissue in response to training and protein intake. It’s the biological “on switch” for maintaining lean mass.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            After 50, this process becomes less sensitive — a phenomenon known as <strong>anabolic resistance</strong>. In practical terms, it means your muscles require a stronger signal (more protein per meal and consistent resistance training) to achieve the same response you once got with less effort.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The Protein Lab estimates daily protein needs and per-meal MPS threshold based on body weight, training status, and current lean mass. It’s designed to help you apply evidence-based ranges consistently — not chase perfection.

            Protein strategy works best when viewed as a long-term pattern, not a daily scorecard. Consistent intake across weeks matters far more than hitting an exact number on any single day.

        Why Protein & MPS Matter After 50
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As anabolic resistance increases, under-dosing protein becomes one of the fastest ways to lose lean mass — even while training. The solution is not extreme diets, but smarter distribution and sufficient total intake.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Adequate protein intake supports muscle retention, strength, metabolic rate, and recovery capacity — all of which become increasingly valuable with age.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-lg mb-6">
        <li>Helps counter age-related muscle loss</li>
        <li>Supports strength and metabolic health</li>
        <li>Improves recovery between training sessions</li>
        <li>One of the most controllable variables in healthy aging</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-neutral-400 italic font-mono mb-8">
        Your muscles don’t stop responding — they just stop responding to weak signals.
    </p>

        How to Optimize Protein Intake (50+ Edition)
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Protein targets are best treated as ranges. Consistency across meals matters more than hitting a precise number.
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg mb-6">
        <li>Target total daily intake of approximately <strong>1.6–2.2 g/kg</strong> body weight.</li>
        <li>Distribute protein evenly across meals, aiming for <strong>30–40 g per meal</strong>.</li>
        <li>Favor leucine-rich sources (whey, eggs, dairy, meat) when possible.</li>
        <li>Use the <a href="protein-lab.html" class="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300">Protein Lab</a> to estimate practical thresholds.</li>
        <li>Reassess body composition every 8–12 weeks and adjust if lean mass trends downward.</li>
    </ol>

        Quick Next Step
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Establish your protein targets in the <a href="protein-lab.html" class="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300">Protein Lab</a>. Track intake patterns for one week. Adjust weak meals. Recheck body composition in 8–12 weeks. This is how muscle preservation becomes deliberate instead of accidental.
