                The Site offers free, self-directed calculators, trackers, and reference information based on publicly available scientific formulas and research (e.g., VO₂ Max estimates, FFMI, grip strength norms). It is maintained by an individual for personal interest and sharing with others in a similar demographic. No registration, data collection, or commercial activity occurs. All content is for general informational and educational purposes only.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Site does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or personalized health plans. It is not a substitute for consultation with qualified healthcare professionals.

            </p>
