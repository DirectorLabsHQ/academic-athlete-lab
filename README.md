# 🦾 Academic Athlete Lab | Strength Intelligence

### "Precision Programming. Evidence-Based Results."
Academic Athlete Lab is a high-performance utility designed to bridge the gap between sports science and the weight room. Part of the **DirectorLabsHQ** network.

## 🧪 Scientific Foundation
Our primary diagnostic uses the **Brzycki Formula**, a mathematically rigorous model for estimating 1RM based on the inverse relationship between repetitions and resistance.

## 🛠️ Performance Features
- **Rolling Max Diagnostic:** Animated counter for real-time strength projection.
- **Dynamic Intensity Bars:** Visualizes the relationship between volume and intensity.
- **Smart Logic:** Automated LBS/KG conversion and input clamping for data integrity.

## 🔒 The DirectorLabsHQ Standard
Like all assets in the DirectorLabsHQ network, this tool is privacy-centric, requiring no account creation and executing all logic locally in the browser.
