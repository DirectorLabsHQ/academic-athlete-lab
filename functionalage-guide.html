            Functional age reflects how your body performs in everyday life — your ability to stand up, balance, carry loads, climb stairs, and move with control. It’s a practical measure of capability and independence, not just how many years you’ve lived.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Functional Age Lab estimates this using simple, evidence-informed performance tests such as sit-to-stand speed, balance time, grip strength, and basic mobility. These measures are widely used as proxies for functional capacity across age groups.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Within Academic Athlete Lab, functional age serves as a capability dashboard — showing whether your training and daily habits are helping you stay resilient, or allowing physical capacity to quietly slip.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Functional age works best as a trend metric. Testing every 8–12 weeks provides a clear signal of whether mobility, strength, and balance are improving, holding steady, or being neglected.

        Why Functional Age Matters After 50
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Chronological age is fixed. Functional age determines whether daily tasks feel effortless or demanding — and how confidently you move through the world.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Large population studies consistently show that poor functional performance (e.g., slow sit-to-stand, weak balance, low grip) predicts higher risk of falls, disability, and loss of autonomy.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The encouraging part: strength, balance, and mobility remain highly trainable well into later decades.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-lg mb-8">

        <li>Provides feedback that cardio or scales can’t</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-neutral-400 italic font-mono mb-10">
        Capability beats perfection. Train what lets you live well.

        How to Test & Improve Functional Age Safely
    </h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Functional age testing is simple and low-risk when performed conservatively and with attention to form and safety.
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg mb-8">
        <li><strong>Select key tests</strong>: Sit-to-stand (timed), single-leg balance, timed up-and-go, or grip strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm up</strong>: Light movement and gentle mobility for 5–10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Test conservatively</strong>: Use stable surfaces and stop if pain or instability appears.</li>
        <li><strong>Estimate consistently</strong>: Enter results into the
            <a href="functional-age.html" class="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300">Functional Age Lab</a>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Train capacity</strong>: Emphasize lower-body strength, balance drills, mobility, and low-impact conditioning 2–3× per week.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text-neutral-400 text-sm italic font-mono mb-12">
        This tool provides functional feedback, not medical diagnosis. If pain or instability persists, consult a qualified professional.
