            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Watts per kilogram (watts/kg) is your sustainable power output divided by your body weight. It’s the single most important metric for climbing performance, relative endurance, and real-world power — especially after 50 when extra body weight starts feeling like a tax on every hill and every sprint.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The Watts/kg Lab calculates this using your FTP (functional threshold power) and body weight. It compares your ratio to age-adjusted norms, giving you a clear picture of how efficiently you turn energy into forward motion.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Within Academic Athlete Lab, watts/kg serves as a core performance-longevity marker — a way to track whether you’re maintaining relative power or letting gravity slowly win.

        <div class="bg-[#0e0e0e] border border-[#222] rounded-2xl p-8 mb-12">
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Watts/kg is a trend metric, not a daily score. Test it every 8–12 weeks to see if your training is sharpening your engine or if extra body weight (or loss of power) is dragging you down.

                <strong>Quick win:</strong> Estimate your FTP (from a 20-minute all-out effort or ramp test), weigh yourself, and calculate your watts/kg in the <a href="watts-lab.html" class="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300">Watts/kg Lab</a> right now. Log the number. Retest in 8–12 weeks after focused power work, Zone 2 volume, and body composition tweaks. That’s how you stay light on the climbs — literally.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold italic uppercase mb-6 text-purple-400">
            Why Watts/kg Matters More Than You Might Think After 50
        </h3>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            After 50, absolute power often plateaus or declines slightly — that’s normal. But relative power (watts/kg) is what keeps you fast on hills, efficient on long rides, and capable in real life. A higher watts/kg means you can go farther, faster, with less effort — even as gravity and time try to pull you back.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Research shows that power-to-weight ratio is one of the best predictors of endurance performance in masters athletes — and it’s highly trainable with smart programming (Zone 2 volume + targeted strength/power work).
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-lg mb-6">
            <li>Directly improves climbing and acceleration efficiency</li>
            <li>Linked to better metabolic flexibility and endurance</li>
            <li>Protects against age-related power decline</li>
            <li>Keeps you functional and fast in daily life</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-neutral-400 italic font-mono mb-8">
            Watts/kg doesn’t care about your birthday — it cares about how much power you can produce per pound of you. Keep the power up, keep the weight in check, and the hills start to feel optional.
        </p>

            How to Test & Improve Watts/kg Safely (50+ Edition)
        </h3>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Accurate testing requires a power meter (bike, trainer, or pedals) and a reliable FTP estimate. Field tests are safe and effective for most.
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg mb-6">
            <li><strong>Estimate FTP</strong>: Use a 20-minute all-out effort (95% of average power = FTP) or a ramp test on a smart trainer.</li>
            <li><strong>Weigh yourself</strong>: Same scale, same conditions (morning, fasted).</li>
            <li><strong>Enter into the lab</strong>: Plug FTP and weight into the <a href="watts-lab.html" class="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300">Watts/kg Lab</a> to get your ratio and percentile.</li>
            <li><strong>Track every 8–12 weeks</strong>: Look for stability or slow improvement — not daily noise.</li>
            <li><strong>Train it</strong>: Build with Zone 2 volume (60–70% FTP) 150–300 min/week + targeted tempo or sweet-spot intervals and strength work. Reduce body fat sustainably if needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="text-neutral-400 text-sm italic font-mono mb-8">
            If you experience unusual fatigue, dizziness, or chest pain during testing, stop immediately and consult a physician.
